# Data

Processed data are kept separate from the original Elections Canada data sets. The first folder, `processed`, includes data that have been cleaned and wrangled. Data in this folder are saved in .csv and .Rds file formats and organized logically in sub-folders. The `raw` folder contains data from Elections Canada that have not been modified in any way.
